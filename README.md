# Chaos Mode

Welcome to Chaos Mode!
A game created in the *Ludum Dare* Game Jam 52 under the theme *Harvest*.

You are late on a date and must clean your apartment before you leave, but
your stupid old vacuum robot is low on energy and can only run in chaos mode!
Click to place your foot on the ground and direct your robot to all specks of
dust as fast as possible. The faster you can leave, the better!


## Controls
* Left mouse click: place foot
* Scroll wheel: rotate foot
